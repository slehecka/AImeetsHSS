**WHAT**

The aim of the conference is to explore and reflect the current and future AI research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and at the same time the future of these paradigms in the age of AI.

During the conference, we want to discuss and reflect on the broad topic of AI research with a combination of academy and external (invited) experts exchange views on the changes, challenges and potentials of future research in the context of the Humanities and Social Sciences. The implications that AI will have for the future of our scientific disciplines and their scientific practices will also be critically examined. 

The conference is transdisciplinary in that five institutes of the Austrian Academy of Sciences - together with the thematic platform “Machine Learning at the Austrian Academy of Sciences (MLAS)” - are involved in the organization.
